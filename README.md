# Marce 1994

Hello there,

My name is Pablo and I'm a Full-stack developer. I work mainly with .Net Core and Angular, but I also know other technologies. I'm not active in the open-source community and that's why I don't have much activity here. I use Github most for practice and find code examples.

Technology, crypto, and decentralization enthusiast.
